# vivallo-OS

## What's this?

This project is meant to be a full operating system intended to run on the x86_64 architecture. If you came across this project just by coincidence and you have experience 
working on low-level systems, embedded systems and related stuff, feel free to contribute and to contact me via Discord. 

The project is not intended to be finished in a short period of time, I'm currently a Computer Engineering student and I don't know everything, part of this
project is meant for you, the people out there in the industry and the academia who have lots of experience, to help me achieve the goal of finishing this project.

I'll be honored if you reach me out, and guide throught this proccess, I hope I learn lots from you, as well as I hope you learn from me. Please, don't hesitate to contact me on Discord. 

In the future, I may do some Devlog on YouTube so that we can reach out some new people and create a good community accross this project. 
If you want to know more, please, join my Discord server, I´m so looking forward to colaborating with you :)
